# Cookiecutter template for kotlin

This is a template for bootstraping a simple app in kotlin. It holds the minimal functionality to build and run an app (inspired in the experience of working with golang).

It includes:

- kotlin-stdlib
- junit-jupiter
- kotlin-test-junit5
- slf4j-simple

## Usage

```bash
cookiecutter . -o destionation/path
```
